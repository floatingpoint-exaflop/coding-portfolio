# Module 2 Challenge: Coding Portfolio

This Homework assignment was completed for Week Two of the U of M Bootcamp, to practice making a portfolio using more advanced html and css work, including flexbow and media queries. This portfolio page will be updated with real projects as I gain more skills; the look and feel will likely improve over time as I develop knowledge of CSS and HTML features too.
